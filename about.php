            <h3>Role and Mission</h3>
            <p>The Web Discuss Forum is an academic unit of the Graduate Division
                that
                prepares graduate students for Web development at WD Discuss and for the teaching they will do
                in
                future academic and nonacademic careers.<br> We also work closely with faculty and departments to assist
                them in
                the mentoring and teaching preparation they offer graduate students. We are guided in our work by the
                Advisory Committee for GSI Affairs, a sub-committee of the Academic Senate’s Graduate Council that
                includes
                both faculty and graduate student members.<br><br>

                We provide conferences, workshops, seminars, confidential consultations, classroom observations (with or
                without video-recording), grants, awards, an online teaching guide, and a robust web-based course on
                professional standards and ethics in teaching. We also provide language testing and specialized courses
                for
                current and prospective international GSIs at UC Berkeley. We offer a Certificate Program in Teaching
                and
                Learning in Higher Education, which provides evidence of GSIs’ development activities as instructors for
                their curriculum vitae.<br> For advanced graduate students we offer, in collaboration with the Graduate
                Division’s Academic Services unit, the Summer Institute for Preparing Future Faculty and the SMART
                program.
                For faculty who teach with GSIs we offer an annual, three-afternoon seminar on Teaching with GSIs.</p>
